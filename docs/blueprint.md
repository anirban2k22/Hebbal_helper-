# **App Name**: Hebbal Helper

## Core Features:

- Truck Timings: Display garbage truck arrival times for the Hebbal area, including truck number/name, route, and expected arrival time. This information is mock data, as the application has no backend.
- Dump Point Locator: Show a map (using OpenStreetMap) with pins marking waste collection points in Hebbal.  Each point displays its name, a short description and waste types accepted. This information is mock data, as the application has no backend.
- Waste Segregation Guide: Display simple instructions on how to segregate waste into wet, dry, and hazardous categories, with examples.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Gold/Yellow (#FFD700) to highlight key elements and call-to-action items, giving an impression of civic duty.
- Background color: Very light desaturated yellow (#F2F2F2), close to white, to ensure readability and a clean interface.
- Accent color: Deep Blue (#0A418F), slightly to the left of gold on the color wheel, to complement the primary color and provide strong visual contrast for interactive elements.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for a modern, approachable, and readable text throughout the application.
- Use clear, simple icons to represent each waste category (wet, dry, hazardous) and map markers for the dump points.
- Simple tab-based navigation for Truck Timings, Dump Points, and Segregation Guide.
- Subtle animations when the user switches between the different tabs to improve UX
